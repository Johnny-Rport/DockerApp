# DockerApp
This will have the source files of a C++ app I made, inspired by Algorithm Visualisers on youtube.
My goal is to containerize it on Linux and deploy on other platforms like Windows and other distributions through docker. 

I'll add how to compile it manually on Linux with SFML including a makefile for handling multiple compiling commands.
